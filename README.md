# ColourFlow for web

This is a HTML5 + JavaScript version of the ColourFlow iOS app. This README is still in progress. Meanwhile, you can go and read the iOS README [here](https://github.com/ivan-avalos/ColourFlow-iOS). Maybe this weekend I'll be writing the entire README but now I really need to sleep, because I'm super tired and I have an important presentation tomorrow at school.

You might be able to find a demo [here](https://ivan-avalos.github.io/ColourFlow-web), but I'm not sure, since I haven't uploaded this project to GitHub yet, and the project contains capital letters, maybe will work.

## Important

This app won't work in iOS and Android devices, only in desktop web browsers such as Safari, Firefox and Edge. Also, I'm new to HTML5 and also new with many JavaScript concepts. If I'm doing something wrong, you're free to correct anything: I accept pull requests :D. I hope you have fun with it.
